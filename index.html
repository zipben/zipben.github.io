                <h2>Wick and Wander</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>Wick and Wander</em> is an immersive <strong>Tabletop Role-Playing Game</strong> designed for <strong>2-6 players and one Lore Keeper</strong>. Drawing inspiration from various <em>Powered by the Apocalypse</em> games, but featuring a unique card-based resolution system, the game emphasizes exploration and player relationships over combat, creating intense narrative adventures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The world is one of pastoral abundance where we find humanity, having recovered from the climate apocalypse, learning to live in harmony with an enigmatic force known as <strong>the weave</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Human communities huddle around a network of stabilizing artifacts known as <strong>the singing stones</strong>, which protect them from the chaos of the wild world outside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our players are from one of many such communities dotting the now verdant landscape. While the world outside is dangerous, it is also beautiful, vast, and full of wonder.
                </p>
