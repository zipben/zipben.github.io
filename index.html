            <h2>Wick and Wander</h2>
            <p>
                Wick and Wander is a card based Role Playing game for 2-6 players and a Lore Keeper. It is inspired by many Powered by the Apocalypse games but uses its own card based resolution system designed to encourage highly narrative play and tends to avoid combat in favor of exploration.

            <p>
                The world is one of pastoral abundance where humanity has recovered from a climate apocalypse and now works to live in harmony with a supernatural force known as the weave. This force permeates everything, allowing nature to change and grow in unpredictable ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                Human communities huddle around a network of stabilizing artifacts known as the singing stones, which protect them from the chaos of the wild world outside.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our players are from one of many such communities dotting the now verdant landscape. While the world outside is dangerous, it is also beautiful, vast, and full of wonder.
