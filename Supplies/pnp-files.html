                <h2>Flux</h2>
                <p>
                    Whatever force allows the weave to transform the natural world has rooted itself deep within you. Your physical features are constantly shifting. Your mood plays across your skin, turning blue and semi translucent, or red and pulsing with a gentle glow.
                </p>
                <h3>Feature</h3>
                <p class="sub-content">
                    You may change the color and luminance of your skin at will.

                <h2>Sprouted</h2>
                <p>
                    You were very near death at some point in the past. In that moment, Kel the Deamon of Death, touched you, but you asked to stay. What was left is a handprint of rough skin that sprouts a single bodum fruit. Small berry branches, or delicate mushrooms are common.
                </p>

                    You may give an additional thread to another player around the table. The nature of that thread is up to the two of you.

                <h2>Pearl</h2>
                <p>
                    You were born with white pearlescent eyes that glimmer and change colour in the sunlight like a seashell fragment.  You do not see like other people do, instead you see the currents and eddies of the weave itself.  You see explosions of light and colour.  Rushing lines of energy coiling around everything.  Singing stones limit this ability, and those who wear stone fragments are effectively invisible, though you see the weave flowing around them.  As though you could see the river, but not the rock.  You may have needed assistance navigating your community when you were younger since it likely exists entirely within a singing stone’s calming zone. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typically, a pearl will have their stone fragment mounted to a staff of some kind so that they are protected from the meddling of daemons, but can periodically extend the stone end away from themselves, leaving the zone of calm, and allowing them to see.

                    When you observe Daemons, you can also see a current indicating where they came from and where they are going.

                <h2>Mended</h2>
                <p>
                    Occasionally Kel will ignore someone, leaving them to seek another afterlife.  Most will simply die, but some tiny number are found by Kitsu in the fleeting moments between life and death.  Kitsu is the mender.  They will examine something and do their best to rebuild what has been damaged, replacing limbs and closing splayed rib cages.  Folks who have been mended return as something more than themselves, and are often shunned and distrusted by their community, with some suggesting that Kel’s disinterest is a kind of judgement.  Mended will often have delicate lines of liquid gold filigree spreading over large sections of their body tying together sections of mismatched skin, some of which might not look like flesh at all.  They cannot be turned into bodum.

                <h2>Grafted</h2>
                <p>
                    Grafting human beings, that is taking characteristics from a plant or animal and applying it to a living human, is forbidden in almost every part of The Horn.  Despite that, it does happen, sometimes out of hubris, and sometimes out of necessity.

                    A small creature is drawn to your graft.  It follows you everywhere, and you’ve grown quite attached to it.

                <h2> Anachronist</h2>
                <p>
                    As a child, your parents would tell you stories of the world before the awakening.  Wondrous and terrifying warnings about destructive communities living without the weave.  Yet buried in the horrors were glimmers of brilliance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After your parents passed, you found a small package in the back of their closet.  A small relic  wrapped in wax paper and hidden away.  You don’t know what it might have been for, but it thrums with power.  
                </p>  
                <p>
                    You would learn as an adult that your parents were at odds with the community. Their fixation on the past was viewed with suspicion. So you inherited two things from your parents.
