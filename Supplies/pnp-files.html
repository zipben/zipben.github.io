                    The game uses a unique card driven resolution mechanic.  while we are developing the game print at home cards or proxies are the easiest way to give it a try.

                    Alternatively, you may proxy the game using something like Magic the Gathering.  MTG is well suited as a proxy since you can use lands as the basic attributes.  The breakdown of cards per player is as follows (excluding the lore keeper who does not have a deck)
