                <h2>The Naturalist</h2>
                <p>
                    The world of Wick and Wander is abundant. Medicinal plants can match or exceed the efficacy of pre-collapse medicine, but they require a skilled practitioner to prepare them correctly. Shifting characteristics from plants to animals, or extracting those characteristics for later is not something to be done lightly.

                <h2>The Atlas</h2>
                <p>
                    The weave brings rapid and unpredictable change.  Landmarks can shift out of focus or disappear entirely.  The Atlas is someone whoâ€™s attunement and preternatural sense of direction allows them navigate an ever changing landscape.  A guide, a tracker, and a map maker.

                <h2>The Conduit</h2>
                <p>
                    The Conduit is someone born with the rare ability to create or modify Daemons.  Complex spiritual automata, Daemons are created with a single vocation, a goal they will pursue doggedly for as long as they exist.  Nobody truly understands them, but the Conduit comes close.

                <h2>The Catalyst</h2>
                <p>
                    The weave itself has substance and power even in the absence of Daemons.  The Catalyst is someone who can sense, and direct, the flow of the weave in crude but powerful ways.

                <p>
                    The history of our world can be found in books, songs, and stories, but the deep truth of things are whispered on the wind, or written into the bark of trees.  Poets know much about the world as it is and will spend their whole lives trying to put to paper those things for which we have no words.

                <p>
                    The Scarred is so fiercely devoted to their community that they are willing to sacrifice themselves in its defense.  Violence is a burden borne by the soul and they choose to shoulder it on behalf of those they love.
