                <p>Wick and Wander is a card driven TTRPG that uses a custom deck of attribute cards to capture a characters nature.  It is inspired by PbtA and so uses moves to capture what characters might want to do while exploring the world. Each character has access to a set of common moves, special moves, community moves and a small set of moves associated with their personal Path and History.
                </p>
                <p>
                As players explore the world, they may want to attempt particular actions, or be forced to by circumstance.  If the actions they want to attempt are non-trivial then players and the Lore Keeper (LK) work together to find a move that captures the players intent.  The player makes a test.

                <h2>Testing</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Declare the move you are using and the attribute you are testing for. If a move has multiple options such as Lore or Empathy, you must choose one before the test begins, and only that one is considered for the test.</li>
                    <li>Draw cards from your character deck, moving them to your discard pile as you draw them. Continue until one of the following things happens. Tests cannot be stopped prematurely.
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>You draw the attribute you are looking for - Count the number of cards flipped and follow the instructions on the Degrees of Complication table</li>
                            <li>You draw a Thread - Threads are considered wild during a test. This is equivalent to finding the attribute you are testing for but must include a rationale for how the thread (typically a person) factors into the resulting narrative. A thread always constitutes a Minor Complication no matter how many cards have been drawn. Bringing the person into the narrative doesn’t require that you reference the source question (i.e., it doesn’t have to explicitly be your love for the person that drives the narrative, just the person themselves).
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Examples
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>They physically help you</li>
                                            <li>They taught you how to do this</li>
                                            <li>They inspire you to do this</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>You draw a stitch card - stitch cards behave exactly like threads except instead of referencing a person, they reference a season. Include some memory from a past season in the narrative. The memories do not need to be perfectly accurate. Memories rarely are.</li>
                            <li>You draw an Injury card - The test ends with a Major Complication. The player chooses an Injury from their character sheet, and the Lore Keeper includes it in the narrative.</li>
                            <li>You draw a relic card. Place it back in your tableau and continue the test. Relics don't count towards your complication total.</li>
                            <li>You exhaust your deck - The test ends with a Major Complication as you are forced to take a breath. The Lore Keeper should try and work your exhaustion into the narrative. After you have resolved any complications, shuffle your discard pile back into your draw deck.</li>
                        </ol>

                <h2>Basic Moves</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Reflect on what you’ve learned: When you want to remember something, test with Lore.</li>
                    <li>Find what you are looking for: When you want to know something specific about the immediate area, test with Lore.</li>
                    <li>Attune to the weave: When you want to listen for Daemons or creatures nearby and understand something specific about them, test with Harmony.</li>
                    <li>Push yourself to your limits: When you push your body or mind to its limit, test with Power.</li>
                    <li>Listen and be heard: When you want to understand someone's intentions or convince them of something, test with Empathy.</li>
                    <li>Step Lightly: When you want to move carefully or avoid detection, test with Grace.</li>
                    <li>Survive: When you are the target of violence and want to avoid injury, test with Grace or Power.</li>
                    <li>Improvise: When you are trying to solve a problem in an unconventional way, you may improvise. Describe what you are attempting to do and test with the appropriate attribute. This move always comes with a complication.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Special Moves</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Provide Care: Once per day when you make camp and wish to help another party member remove an injury, explain how you care for them, then have them remove a single injury of their choice from their discard pile or draw deck. If they searched through their draw deck, have them shuffle it now.</li>
                    <li>Use Relic: When you would like to use one of your relics to shift the outcome of a test in your favor, move the relic card from your character tableau to your discard pile. The complication severity is decreased. Major Complications become Minor Complications, and Minor Complications become Favored Outcomes.</li>
                    <li>Return to the weave: When all available injuries have been added to your deck you fall unconscious, check if it is your time to return to the weave. Shuffle your character deck. Draw until you encounter a thread or an injury.
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>If you draw a thread, explain how that person pulled you back from the brink, remove 1 injury from your deck, you are now conscious.</li>
                            <li>If you draw an injury card, your character has died, describe how they pass, and which form they want to take in death. Kel will visit them once their stone fragment is removed.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Grow: When you encounter a bodum, you may harvest some piece of it, and after consuming it, add a thread to your character deck. The Lore Keeper should help explain the memory you’ve found.</li>
                    <li>Reflect: When you have arrived home after a long journey and the season is drawing to a close, you and your companions should take time to reflect on the journey you’ve been on. Go through your threads and talk with the group about how that relationship has changed and how you have been changed by it then set the thread aside. This will help prepare you for the next season of the game.</li>
